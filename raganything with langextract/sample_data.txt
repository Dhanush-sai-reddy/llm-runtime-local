INTER-DEPARTMENTAL NOTES & CROSS-REFERENCES
──────────────────────────────────────────────

NOTE 1 — Shared Provider Alert (Dr. Okafor):
Dr. Okafor serves as PCP for both Rajesh Venkataraman (MRN-0847) and Eleanor Whitfield (MRN-1234). Care coordination meeting held 2024-02-20 with cardiology (Dr. Krishnamurthy) re: both patients — optimizing shared heart failure protocols. Dr. Krishnamurthy consulted on both cases for cardiac management.

NOTE 2 — Pharmacy Cross-Reference:
Mercy Pharmacy flagged potential interaction for Eleanor Whitfield: Eliquis + NSAID risk. Confirmed with Dr. Tanaka that patient is on acetaminophen only (no NSAIDs due to CKD). Rajesh Venkataraman's dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin + Plavix) also flagged — confirmed appropriate post-PCI per Dr. Reeves.

NOTE 3 — Social Work Coordination:
Linda Park (Social Worker for Venkataraman cardiac rehab) and Maria Castellanos (Social Worker for Delgado-Rivera psychiatric care) co-facilitated a departmental seminar on "Stress, Cardiovascular Risk, and Mental Health" on 2024-04-15, referencing anonymized data from both cases.

NOTE 4 — Quality Metrics:
- Venkataraman STEMI: Door-to-balloon 62 minutes (benchmark: <90) — EXCEEDS TARGET
- Whitfield Dialysis Initiation: Catheter to first HD session: 1 day — MEETS TARGET
- Delgado-Rivera Psych Hold: Length of stay 14 days — within expected range for schizophreniform

NOTE 5 — Overlapping Medication Classes:
Three-patient medication analysis reveals shared medication patterns:
- Pantoprazole: Venkataraman (40mg) and Whitfield (20mg) — GI prophylaxis in polypharmacy patients
- Metoprolol: Venkataraman (succinate 50mg) and Whitfield (tartrate 25mg BID) — different formulations per indication
- Aspirin 81mg: Both Venkataraman and Whitfield

NOTE 6 — Research Registry:
Dr. Tanaka enrolled Eleanor Whitfield in the MERCY-CKD-2024 multicenter trial studying novel phosphate binder efficacy. Dr. Reeves is co-PI on the STENT-OPTIMAL registry tracking DES outcomes — Rajesh Venkataraman enrolled. Both studies approved by Mercy IRB (Chair: Dr. Evelyn Rothschild, MD, PhD).
